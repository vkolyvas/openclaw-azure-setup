##  Common Issues

### Slow Updates

If updates are slow, change to a faster mirror:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's|us.archive.ubuntu.com| mirrors.edge.akamai.net|g' /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
```

### Permission Denied

If you get permission errors, ensure you're using `sudo`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
